# FAQ

This FAQ is a work in progress designed to answer the questions our users most frequently ask about Rancher Desktop.

**Q: Is Rancher Desktop a desktop version of Rancher?**

**A:** No, Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the desktop. Installing Rancher Desktop does not install Rancher, but you can install Rancher as a workload. 

Rancher Desktop is similar to applications like [minikube], [kind], or [Docker Desktop] where the goal is to have an easy to set up local Kubernetes environment to manage containers.

[kind]:

[Docker Desktop]:

**Q: Can I have Docker Desktop installed alongside Rancher Desktop?**

**A:** Yes, there are no conflicts having both installed. You can even run both simultaneously if resources permit.
