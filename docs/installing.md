# Installing Rancher Desktop

Rancher Desktop is delivered as a desktop application. You can download it from
the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rd/releases).

When run for the first time or when changing versions, Kubernetes container
images are downloaded. It may take a little time to load on first run for a new
